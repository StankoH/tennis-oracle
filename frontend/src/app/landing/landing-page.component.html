    <h1>Bonzobyte</h1>
    <p>Tennis analytics powered by data, not hype.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>What is Bonzobyte?</h2>
    <p>
      Bonzobyte is an independent tennis analytics platform built with one goal in mind: to provide the most detailed and accurate insights into matches, players, and performance ‚Äì all driven by real data and custom-built models.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What makes it different?</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of surface-level stats, Bonzobyte uses our own neural networks, Bayesian ranking models, and custom implementations of TrueSkill to generate predictive analytics and player evaluation metrics. All match data is hand-cleaned, structured and compressed for efficiency.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why we built it</h2>
    <p>
      This project began as a passion for tennis and technology ‚Äì a hobby that grew into a serious engineering effort. Bonzobyte is not a commercial product; it's a living, evolving project that reflects our curiosity, discipline, and love for the sport.
    </p>
